Generated vertically polarized light by the Brewster's reflected beam, then fed
through the polariser used in our experiment. This was at maximum intensity
when the polariser was about 45 degrees through its rotation relative to our
zero point (50 / 400 steps), and minimum at about 135 degrees (150 / 400 steps).

This means the polariser's axis of polarisation about 45 degrees ahead of that
measured from it's zero point. Since the laser was at a maximum intensity when
the polariser was at TODO steps into the cycle, the laser itself was TODO
polarised in an absolute sense.
